## Customer Trends And Churn Analysis

### Project 2b: Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
I analyzed **customer retention patterns** for *Call Now Customer Service Company*, focusing on **internet service type, contract length, and payment methods**.  

The goal was to identify the drivers of **customer churn** and recommend strategies to improve **retention and revenue stability**.

## The Problem

-  **Fiber Optic Internet Customers:** Churn rate at **41.9%**, highlighting major retention challenges.

-  **Expand technical support capacity** for fiber optic customers, targeting a **$0.50 reduction in support tickets per customer** to improve satisfaction and reduce churn.  
-  Launch **loyalty incentives** for short-term contract customers to encourage switching to longer contracts.
